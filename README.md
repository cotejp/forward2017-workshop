# ForwardJS Ottawa 2017 Workshop

This is the source code for my **[Physical Computing For Web Developers](https://forwardjs.com/ottawa#physical-computing-for-web-developers)** 
workshop held during **[ForwardJS](https://forwardjs.com/ottawa)** in Ottawa (April 7, 2017).

The JavaScript files are broken dow into steps (a, b, c, etc.). The final step includes the full 
code for that exercise. If you want to catch up with the group, simply use the JavaScript file 
matching were the group is at.

Node.js modules have not been uploaded to GitHub. After downloading the sources, you can easily 
install all necessary Node modules by issuing `npm install` from within each exercise's folder. This 
will install all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

Have fun!
